RStudio

top data visualization tools include: ggplot which used for data visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, scatterplots

Plotly is an R package can be used to create web-based data visualizations that can be displayed or saved as individual HTML files

Lattice is a data visualization tool that is used to implement complex, multi-variable data sets. 

Leaflet is very useful in creating interactive plots. 

R also has its own inbuilt functions to create plots and visualization, it is mostly used using the plot function.
Using the Plot function

#simple 
cars <- c(1,4,6,5,10)
plot(cars , type = "o")
title(main = "Cars vs index")

#using ggplot
#mtcars inbuilt dataset

library(ggplot)
ggplot(mtcars , aes(x = miles/gal , y = weight)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("miles per galon vs weght")

#geom_point - used to specify a scatter plot

# GGally extends ggplot2 by adding several functions to reduce the complexity of combining geometric objects with transformed data.
